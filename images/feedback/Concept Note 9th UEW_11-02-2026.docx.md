1. # **Introduction**

The Uganda Evaluation Association (UEA) is a body of professional practitioners that aims to strengthen the knowledge and practices in monitoring and evaluation, research, and learning among its membership. The Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) is the lead Government Agency in promoting the culture of monitoring and Evaluation in government Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs). 

The UEA, in collaboration with the OPM and partners, is organizing the 9th Uganda Evaluation Week (UEW). The week is unique as it marks 25 years of commemoration of UEA's existence. The Uganda Evaluation Week is an annual event that provides a platform for evaluation practitioners from Government, Civil Society, the Private sector, Young and Emerging Evaluators (YEEs), academia, and development partners to discuss and share evidence and lessons arising from development evaluation in Uganda and beyond. It is an opportunity to reflect on ongoing initiatives to understand their effectiveness and impact.

2. # **Background**

Uganda has initiated the implementation of the Fourth National Development Plan (NDP IV) (2025/26–2029/30), which focuses on sustainable industrialisation, infrastructure development, private sector-led growth, human capital investment, and efficient public service delivery. It is also the first Plan in the implementation of the Government's Strategy to grow the economy tenfold by 2040, a strategy that aims to fast-track the realisation of socio-economic transformation. Evaluation and evidence generation are central to tracking progress and ensuring that interventions are impactful, inclusive, and aligned with the national development goals and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

At the same time, global trends in monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) reflect a growing emphasis on technology, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), real-time data analytics, well-being metrics, inclusive participation, and the use of evidence in public decision-making. The 9th Uganda Evaluation Week will convene stakeholders across sectors to explore how these emerging tools and approaches can support Uganda’s transformation agenda under NDP IV.

3. # **Objectives**

* Showcase innovations in AI and digital technology for enhanced accountability and learning from evaluation.  
* Foster dialogue on how M\&E systems can better support inclusive, citizen-centered development.  
* Build capacity among government, civil society, and youth in using modern evaluation tools.  
* Align Uganda’s evaluation practices with global standards and the SDGs in the context of NDP IV.

  **3.1 Expected Outcomes**

* Strengthened support for integration of evidence-use in national development initiatives spanning various sectors.  
* Improved methodologies in evaluations practices and expanded research prospects for both local practitioners and international evaluation stakeholders.
